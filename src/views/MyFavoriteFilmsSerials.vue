      <h1>So... My favorite films/serials.</h1>
      <p>I love films or serials, of course if they are good.</p>
      <p>Some of my personal favorites are =</p>
      <p>As a child i adored dragons, as i do now ~_^, but of course How to train your dragon 1/2/3.</p>
      <p>The sheer amount of work put into all those films are just great, and the style of it is top notch.</p>
      <p>All and all its a nostalgia trip for someone that seen it as a child, but its a great one if you have children.</p>
      <p>I would rate it 10/10</p>

      <h2>Toothless, All rights to Dreamworks.</h2>
      <br>
      <h2>Second is i think... Beastars.</h2>
      <p>The sheer enjoyment i had with this one is great. Great characters, story and of course vizuals,</p>
      <p>because it was my first anime its gorgeus looking, dont get me wrong i like 2d animation, but the 3D and stopmotion intro,</p>
      <p>Is just ahhh.... Great combination, there were some side characters in 2d but they were flawless too.</p>

      <h2>Legoshi the main character.</h2>
      <br>
      <h2>Third would be Chernobyl 2019.</h2>
      <p>God the writing in this one... And the use of perspective is gorgeus.</p>
      <p>Its not the films where you can predict what will be shown. It doesnt start like a normal drama. And i love it!</p>
      <p>Seriously go watch it its on hbo go. 5 parts each 1 hour long. If I may add the best 5 hours you can waste.</p>
      <p>Main character Valery Legasov was played by Jared Harris, he played him flawlessly.</p>
      <p>Nothing else to add 10/10 for me.</p>
      <img src="../assets/images/chernobyl.jpg" width="50%" height="50%">
      <h2>Helicopter scene from Chernobyl.</h2>
      <br>
      <h2>4. Final Space</h2>
      <p>Season one started as a goofy series, but after that it really grew better.</p>
      <p>Each character is great and fun.</p>
      <p>I would highly recommend it even if you dont like cartoons that much.</p>
      <img src="../assets/images/avocato.jpg" width="50%" height="50%">
      <h2>Avocato, one of the characters.</h2>
      <br>
      <h2>5. is Enders Game.</h2>
      <p>Ive seen this film i think when i was 12-13, it blew me away.</p>
      <p>I love scifi, fantasy, mysteries and this... was my first ever good scifi i think.</p>
      <p>Visuals, writing and overall music is great!</p>
      <p>I think its based from a book.</p>
      <p>Its on netflix so go on give it a go!</p>

      <h2>6. WolfWalkers.</h2>
      <p>What do I say? This film is gorgues looking. 2D animation is still one of the best art.</p>
      <p>Dont get me wrong cg is good too, but it is so overused. This film, has a great story</p>
      <p>Fantastic visuals and my god the soundtrack.</p>
      <p>Highly recommend to watch it. If you want something fresh and fantastic looking.</p>

      <h2>Some other films/serials that im just going to say without my thoughs to it.</h2>
      <p>Paper House(Netflix Serial) its spanish cant really translate it.</p>
      <p>Love, Death and Robots(Netflix Serial), extremly high quality animations by different studios, Gore and such not for children!</p>
      <p>Sherlock Holmes(The serial. Its on Netflix but not full), a good serial, if you were wondering im a sucker for mysteries too.</p>
